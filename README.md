# BraveVue - Headless UI Library for Vue js (Vue 3)

BraveVue is a headless UI Library for Vue js applications.
Components are designed to be minimilistic and non-bloated.
BraveVue can work with any of the Popular CSS Frameworks(Tailwind, Bootstrap ...) and Custom CSS.

## Project setup
```
npm i bravevue
```
```
yarn add bravevue
```

## Features. 

- ### Headless
  The Core Library is not dependent upon any CSS Library for Styling. 
  You can completely change the look of the Components as you desire. 

- ### Automic Components. 
  The ideas was to build the library as neat and non-bloated as possible. These components are light weight. 

- ### Extendable
  The Components can use to compose your own components to allow create a further level of Abstraction. 

- ### Tailwind Support
  We love Tailwind and examples coded are in Tailwind. But you can easily use your own styling framework.
