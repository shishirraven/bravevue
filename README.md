# BraveVue - Headless UI Library for Vue js (Vue 3)



BraveVue JS is designed to help you break free of monotonous design and helps you build something UNIQUE & BEAUTIFUL. 
We achieve this by giving your a Styleless Components that you can craft as you like.

You can take BraveVue and build your own style libraries specific to your project. 

BraveVue is a headless UI Library for Vue js applications.
Components are designed to be minimilistic and non-bloated.
BraveVue can work with any of the Popular CSS Frameworks(Tailwind, Bootstrap ...) and Custom CSS.

‚≠ê We appreciate your star, it helps!

## Project setup
```
npm i bravevue
```
```
yarn add bravevue
```


## Use through Plugin. 

```
const { createApp } = require('vue');
import App from "./App.vue";
import bravevue from 'bravevue'
createApp(App).use(bravevue).mount("#app");
```


## Features. 

- ### Headless
  The Core Library is not dependent upon any CSS Library for Styling. 
  You can completely change the look of the Components as you desire. 

- ### Automic Components. 
  The ideas was to build the library as neat and non-bloated as possible. 

- ### Extendable
  Ever project is different but the available UI library makes your project look same. 
  You have control but not complete control over the design unless your drill down into CSS. 

- ### Tailwind Support
  We love Tailwind and examples coded are in Tailwind. But you can easily use your own styling framework.
